Cut off the maximum amount of characters shown for the header title
(If over 20 chars, render a default message or something)

If a user pastes and visits a search link without having a locationObject..
do not render the filters row at all
^^ further consider this scenario

Fix issue with open_now in the URL string
http://localhost:3000/search?limit=50&radius=30000&open_now=open%20now&latitude=29.651958&longitude=-82.325024&price=3&term=chicken

We have a bug where (Hours Unknown) restauarants get listed when we search for places open now
Easy to test late at night- and delivers results we wouldn't want if we have late night munchies

Fix search header
We made it extra safe since users can search URL's without actully having a locationObject saved

Visiting a URL should probably override some searchFilters on arrival

Filters don't re-send Yelp API calls yet

DURING LOADING PHASE OF YELP FETCHING
The message that something has gone wrong on our end pops up
Use a load spinner instead

Consider placing all Account edits on the same tabular page
Go through each form and think about
A) When forms should be cleared in the event of a success or failure
B) When loading spinners should be used to help with loading

LOADING SHOULD BE ADDED WHERE...
The signup process concludes successfully
The account deletion succeeding

TEST EACH MAJOR AUTH FEATURE AND PAY ATTENTION WHERE MORE FEEDBACK WOULD BE NICE

<< sign in >>

<< change email >>

<< delete account >>
Add fullscreen spinner if process succeeds

START A COMMUNAL STYLE FOLDER FOR

auth forms

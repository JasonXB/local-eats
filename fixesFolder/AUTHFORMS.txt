REFACTOR /auth/signup and /auth/changeEmail since they both have absurdly long try catch checks

GO THROUGH AND TEST EACH FEATURE
1) Test every opportunity for user error and communicate well
2) Test success and see if you communicate a success properly
3) Implement loading visuals for when API routes get called

FORGOT PASSWORD FEATURE (make it)

Each time we send a pin, revise the email we send to our users
A) Change the email we send from to something more professional (test on Sendgrid)
B) Provide a link to the website where we can submit our PINs. 
If the user X's out by accident, they need a way to find the page again

Make it so sign up, signIn, and all the other auth procedures no longer utilize LocalStorage
Use query parameters to pass data between pages instead

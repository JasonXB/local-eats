### Business Search

Users can filter their search results to narrow down the types of places they're interested in finding. Results can be shown ordered based on proximity, price, hours of operation, and Yelp rating.

### Restaurant-specific data
By clicking on one of the restaurants returned from a search, users can pull up detailed information about that business. They can find pictures and a description of the food served there, an exact address, their phone number, a link to pull up directions on Google maps, and a small selection of similar restaurants in that general area

### User Authentication 

If one signs up for a Local Eats account using their email, a validation code gets sent to it via the SendGrid service. Once verified, new users can bookmark the restaurants they'd like to save for later.

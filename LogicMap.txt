———————————————————<< PREVIOUS LOCATIONS >>———————————————————

src/state-management/globalContext.js ------------------
We check if there are any locations saved in LocalStorage, then save it to useState()
Since this is a ContextAPI file, we share our saved locations  with any other React file
Every time we get our locations tracked by the web app, a new location should take the place of the old one 


pages/index.js ------------------
We check useState() for any previously saved locations

If none are found, we simply have "Need location" in the Searchbar
Add a pop up message below the searchbar telling them a location is required
The user will have to click the searchbar in order to allow Geolocation tracking
Without geolocation tracking, the API calls to Yelp Fusion will not work

If a location is found, the town name will be written in the searchbar
Users can still hit the geolocation button track themselves again (location may be outdated or inaccurate)

———————————————————<< GEOLOCATION TRACKING >>———————————————————

If a user explicitly denies geolocation tracking, a modal should appear explaining that our site needs it in order to function
Offer them a form to fill in if they prefer to enter a fake location in themselves, in the modal

Prohibit Yelp API calls unless the user has a location saved in LocalStorage
